# bikes_prediction (Supervised Learning)
prediction of bikes demand in Washington State
We had data from the 1/01/2011 until the 31/12/2012 indicating what was the count of bikes used in Washington DC.
Exploration was performed on all the data.
dataset had to be split into train and test, test being the last 3 months of the dataset!

Discovering the easter egg and designing cool features was my favourite part of the project.

Here is a quick explanation of how this project is structured:
1) Exploratory data analysis which led to the discovery of a cool easter egg!
2) Feature engineering 
3) Model training 
4) Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
5) Validation

Any constructive feedback is always welcome and would be greatly appreciated!
