# bikes_prediction (Supervised Learning)
This project is about making predictions concerning the amount of bike users in Washington D.C !

We had data from the 1/01/2011 until the 31/12/2012 indicating what was the count of bikes per hour used in Washington DC.


Here is a quick explanation of how this project is structured:
1) Exploratory data analysis which led to the discovery of a cool easter egg!
2) Feature engineering 
3) Model training with multiple algorithms
4) Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
5) Validation to see how accurate the model is!

Any constructive feedback is always welcome and would be greatly appreciated!
