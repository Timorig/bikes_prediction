# bikes_prediction (Supervised Learning)
This project is about making predictions concerning the amount of bike users in Washington D.C !
We had data from the 1/01/2011 until the 31/12/2012 indicating what was the count of bikes per hour used in Washington DC.
There is a very cool finding when doing the EDA: There are **some missing rows** so some hours in which no data was collected and these events match with **natural hazards** such as the **Carmageddon Snowstorm of January 2011**, **Hurricane Irene in August 2011** and **Hurrican Sandy in October 2012**!


Here is a quick explanation of how this project is structured:
1) **Exploratory data analysis** which led to the discovery of a cool easter egg!
2) **Feature engineering** 
3) **Machine Learning** model training with multiple algorithms
4) Model selection and **hyperparameter tuning**
5) **Validation** to see how accurate the model is!

Any constructive feedback is always welcome and would be greatly appreciated!
